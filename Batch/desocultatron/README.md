 First of all: Thanks to Mr. Sokulski.  
How to use this program:  
    * Download all the files.  
    * Execute the .exe file. It will open the command prompt.
    * In the command prompt, it will ask you the letter of the disk you want to "un-occult".  
        * For example, the common letters used in most Windows systems will be E and F (E:\ or F:\ disks). Write that letter on the prompt.  
    * Your files should appear again. Delete the shortcuts and use your device again.
